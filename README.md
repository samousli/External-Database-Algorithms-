# External-Database-Algorithms

This project contains implementations of external memory MergeSort, RemoveDuplicates based on MergeSort, 
MergeJoin, HashJoin algorithms, 
as well as some simple tools used for the analysis of correctness and performance of said algorithms.

It has been implemented as part of an assignment in the Database Technologies course in Computer Science Department of Aristotle University Greece. It's uploaded to showcase my work and with the hopes that it may help someone else.
